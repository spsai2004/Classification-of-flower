# Classification-of-flower
The dataset is taken from kaggle.
We have viewed data carefully and identified the species attribute as our target variable.
There is a data attribute named id which is not useful in doing this project so we have dropped that particular column and updated the data. 
We believed that the classification can be done efffectively done with "logistic regression model ".
We have trained and tested this model and its giving a good accuracy .
