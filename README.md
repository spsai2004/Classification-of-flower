# Classification-of-flower
The dataset is taken from kaggale 
we have viewed data carefully and identifued  the species attribute as our target variable
There is a data attribute named id which is unuseful in doing this project so we have dropped that paricular column and updated the data 
We believed that the classification can be done efffectively done with "logistic regression model "
we have trained and tested this model and its giving a good accuracy
